# Student Voice
Project Name: Student Complaints Support Chatbot



**Project Description:**


Implementing a 24/7 support chatbot for TBC that will provide an interactive messaging environment to assist students with lodging and tracking complaints regarding various aspects of college life (e.g., academic issues, college services, facilities, etc.).



**Project Purpose & Value to the industry** (This is the value proposition statement of why the project is initiated and how it matters to the business or industry.)


Implementing a 24/7 support chatbot for TBC will streamline complaint lodging and tracking. Employees will benefit from reduced workload, allowing them to focus on complex tasks. Students will receive timely and accurate responses/resolutions anytime, enhancing their satisfaction. This initiative will help the college gather data to identify recurring issues and improve college services.



**Project Scope** (Define the boundary of the project)


The chatbot will be used to log complaints regarding various aspects of college life including academic issues, housing, college services and facilities. This project covers analysis & design, development and testing of a prototype of chatbot plus full documentation that serves as a proof-of-concept supporting functions to the limit of what is provided by TBC stakeholders or a fictional set defined by the students.



**Constraints**:

1. No formal business requirement discovery process is performed.

2. This project is only a proof-of-concept showing the capabilities of the students to the best supported by the information and data from TBC.

3. The end product from this project will not be deployable due to cost constraints and lack of complete business & functional requirements from TBC.

4. The chatbot will not support follow-up questions from the users since the dataset does not provide follow-up data.

5. This project is constrained by its timeline, functionality will be limited to necessities only at the discretion of the project advisor.




**Project End Product(s)** (Define the expected outcome of the project which needs to be tangible and measurable.)


1. The end-product is a prototype as Proof-of-Concept (POC) of the chatbot.

2. Full documentation including but not limited to technical spec, functional spec, source code and installation scripts & procedures, user instruction in form of a library set


**High-Level Requirements** (Define the functional and technical requirements to be met to produce project end product.)


Natural Language Understanding and Generation:

The chatbot can understand and generate human-like responses in text or speech using an NPL model like ChatGPT.


Functional Capabilities:

The chatbot can analyze the query submitted by the user and provide an appropriate response as a form of a resolution to their complaint, or able to direct them to relevant authorities as needed.


Complaint Analytics:

The chatbot allows analysis of each complaint filed in an easily accessible and readable format to allow data analysis and for the organization to better identify recurring issues and improve college services. However, this only guides the system design approach and it should be followed in best effort within the time constraint of the project.



Scalability:

The chatbot is platform neutral and so should be able to work in any environment. The chatbot will be hosted on the Moodle website. However, this only guides the system design approach and it should be followed in best effort within the time constraint of the project.


Performance:

The chatbot can answer user queries effectively and accurately with a response rate of under 1 minute per user.


Expandability:

The chatbotâ€™s technical infrastructure can allow expandability by directly editing the code. An example of expandability includes the ability of adding features later into the chatbot such as, the ability to share the chat transcript via email.


User Interface Design:

The chatbot has a user-friendly interface for interactions. The design should consider user experience (UX) principles and be consistent when hosted on our Moodle dashboard and/or within courses. The design should also consider color theory and contrasts for optimal viewing and be accessible to all users. However, this only guides the system design approach and it should be followed in best effort within the time constraint of the project.



Documentation:

The chatbot should have proper documentation and comments in code for easy readability and understanding, which can allow the project to be further developed and deployed by future teams.




**Project Resources requirement** (If cost-free option of delivering the project is exhausted and the project requires billable resources e.g.: hardware & software, please elaborate and justify the funding request for college pre-approval.)


Availability of suitable and sufficient data such as

The project can be completed using free resources without incurring funding requirements.



**Project Completion Criteria** (Describe & list out what measurable criteria to be met, by which the project can be declared as completed)


The project will be considered complete once all the high-level requirements are tested and met.
